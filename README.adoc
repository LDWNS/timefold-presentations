== Run a presentation

There are 2 presentation types:

* A *reusable slide deck* in `slidedecks`. Useful to start from.
** The `inventory.html` is a special case, it just contains _all_ slides from the docs in arbitrary order.
* An *event specific deck* in `events`. Useful for history purposes.

== Sync the images

To sync the images and extract the SVG layers as PNG:

. Clone this repo next to a `tf-main` dir which contains `timefold-solver` and `timefold-quickstarts`.

. Run the script
+
----
$ src/script/syncImages.sh
----

IMPORTANT: The SVG layers in upstream must have *the first slide at the bottom layer*
and the last slide at the top layer.
This way, later slides can overwrite earlier slides.

WARNING: Before committing the changes, make sure you delete any old svg or png files that got moved.
TODO automate this in the script.
