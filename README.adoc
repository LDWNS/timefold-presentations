== Copy images and extract SVG layers as PNG

. Clone this repo next to a `tf-main` dir which contains `timefold-solver` and `timefold-quickstarts`.

. Run the script
+
----
$ src/script/syncImages.sh
----

IMPORTANT: The SVG layers in upstream must have *the first slide at the bottom layer*
and the last slide at the top layer.
This way, later slides can overwrite earlier slides.

WARNING: Before committing the changes, make sure you delete any old svg or png files that got moved.
